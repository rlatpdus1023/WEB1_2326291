<p style="margin-top:35px;">
<p>The resources of the WWW may be accessed by users by a software application called a <strong> web browser</strong>.
  Web resources may be any type of downloaded media, but web pages are hypertext media that have been formatted in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).[7] Such formatting allows for embedded hyperlinks that contain URLs and permit users to navigate to other web resources.
  In addition to text, web pages may contain images, video, audio, and software components that are rendered in the user's web browser as coherent pages of multimedia content. </p>
